# docker-django-polymer
This is a docker file for django polymer web project.



# Todo

- create repo docker-base
- sublink to generator-dockerized django-polymer 
- add comments to explain


- need to separate 





# Docker Image
 > base 
  - this has been included if required custom modification (from docker-base in github)
  - has some dependencies when called (requirements etc)
  

 - app
  - derived from docker-base:latest from docker hub ( 'docker-base' automated build via docker hub to keep up to date )
  - requires manual build, tagging & deployment
  - why not automated build via docker hub ---- more flexibility without, need a different .yml for production etc.




# How to get started 


# Docker Images explained




# App Docker Image 
 - use a base image - dockerfile and stuff included in case you want to see - automated build so always latest
 - app  manual updates



# Rebuild and Upload base image 

- Automated build via docker hub. Easy set up. As we need to create a new docker-compose file for production use script instead (see below)

or

> docker login
  - you will need to login into docker hub (set up an account if you dont have one)
> docker build -t "jtarball/docker-base:latest" .
  - this will build the Dockerfile in the current directory and tag it with "jtarball/docker-base:latest"
> docker push "jtarball/docker-base:latest"
  - push to docker hub


# Useful Commands

> docker-compose up 
 - this command will create and start containers

> docker rm $(docker ps -a -q); docker rmi $(docker images -q);
 - kill and remove all docker images and containers

> docker rmi $(docker images -q --filter "dangling=true")
 - Ckean up un-tagged docker images





Docker linguistics borrow from git terminology, but itâ€™s rather dangerous to interpret these too literally.
Keeping a clean docker environment

run interactive containers with --rm flag to avoid having to remove them later.

Remove all stopped containers:

Clean up un-tagged docker images:
docker rmi $(docker images -q --filter "dangling=true")
Stop and remove all containers (including running containers!)

## Yeoman generator for Django Polymer projects

<img src="http://yeoman.io/assets/img/tool-yo.3dcc.png" />

### Introduction to generator-django-polymer

Yeoman generator that scaffolds out a Django project with Polymer.

> This generator extends [generator-polymer](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-polymer) and integrates it with a Django project generator

### Why extend generator-polymer?

Google Polymer is an awesome framework leveraging the new standards of web components however 
it is still a relatively new framework.

As of yet it has even reached version 1.0 likely to change which will have a knock on effect to 
the best standards and practices for Polymer project layouts/scaffolds.

Thus this generator project will periodically integrate new changes from __generator-polymer__
to incorporate the latest changes, methods and best practices

This currently is a better solution than creating a rigid custom layout for a Polymer compatible app which may change.

### How is Django and Polymer integrated in this project?
This is likely to be the more important question when deciding whether to use this generator or not.

Main points:

* The output of **generator-polymer** is kept largerly intact. 
* We symbolic link all polymer elements to Django's static folder.
* Routing is still performed by Django's urls
* Django templating is still used but is minimally required with a project like this compared to a standard Django project. See generated output for example on use.
* Where conflicts exist in templating we use the __verbatim__ django tag.

Thus, we get a project that has all the benefits of a polymer frontend app as well as all the benefits of Django's backend environment including
urls, templating etc. without having to interleave both projects in a complex way.

*in theory, if you decided that Polymer was not for you; removing it without affecting the Django project should be easy.*


### Directory Structure
The settings files are split for better separate of roles:

* __README.md__

> this file

* __app/__

> this is created by __generator-polymer__ Do not move or rename to keep compatible with polymer generator commands

* __bower_components__

> this folder is also created by __generator-polymer__

* __apps/__

> Django apps folder

* __project/__

> Django Project folder

* __tests/__

> Unit tests folder

* __Gulpfile.js | Gruntfile.js | etc. 
...__

> optional files created by *generator-polymer* 

### Considerations / Future
In the future I might consider incorporating ideas from the following projects:

* https://github.com/imkevinxu/django-kevin
* https://github.com/luzfcb/cookiecutter-django-oauth
* https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-django

*e.g. caching, sendGrid email support, heroku, better management*
